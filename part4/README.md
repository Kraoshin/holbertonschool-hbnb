HBNB - Web Application Backend
In this project, we have implemented the phase of the application based on the design developed in the previous part. We have focused on the Persistence, Business Logic, and API Layers. This project is built using Python and Flask.
We created the structure of the project, developed the classes that define the business logic, and implemented the API endpoints.
We also manage users, places, reviews, and amenities.
